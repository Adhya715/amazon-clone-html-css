# Amazon Clone (HTML & CSS)

> My first web development project, built during holidays, using HTML & CSS

## About:

This is a clone of the Amazon homepage UI — built purely with **HTML** and **CSS**. As my first project, it helped me get hands-on experience with web layouts, styling, and responsive design basics. It’s not functional in terms of backend, but it aims to replicate the look and feel of Amazon’s front page.

## Built With:

- HTML  
- CSS  
- Visual Studio Code as the development environment

## What I Learned:

- Structuring HTML properly  
- Using CSS for layout (flex, grid, positioning)  
- Styling images, cards, navigation bar, and hero sections
